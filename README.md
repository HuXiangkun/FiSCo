## Huggingface
This collection includes the following datasets:

| Name | Description / Purpose | Format & Size | Notes / Special Features |
|---|---|---|---|
| **age_bias_with_human_label** | Text instances annotated with human labels regarding age-based bias | Parquet, ~10 K–100 K size :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1} | Contains prompts / responses involving age (“young”, “old”, etc.). :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2} |
| **gender_bias_with_human_label** | Text instances annotated with human labels regarding gender-based bias | Parquet, ~10 K–100 K size :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3} | Gender-group bias evaluation dataset |
| **race_bias_with_human_label** | Text instances annotated with human labels regarding race-based bias | Parquet, ~10 K–100 K size :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4} | Race-based group fairness evaluation dataset |
| **bias_example_with_reward** | Examples linking bias-laden prompts or responses with reward signals | 200-500 | Useful for connecting bias to reward modeling or RL-based fairness mitigation |

## How to Use These Datasets

Here’s a suggested pattern for how to load and use these datasets in your code:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

ds = load_dataset("groupfairnessllm", "age_bias_with_human_label")
# ds will have splits such as train, validation, etc. (or a single default split)

# Example: examine fields
print(ds["train"].column_names)
print(ds["train"][0])
```

## AWS bedrock Setup

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your_aws_access_key_id>
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your_aws_secret_access_key>
export AWS_REGION_NAME=<your_aws_region_name>
```

## OpenAI Setup
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=""
```

## vllm Setup
Please use vllm to setup the API server for open source LLMs. For example, use the following command to deploy a Llama 3 8B hosted on HuggingFace:
```bash
python -m vllm.entrypoints.openai.api_server \
  --model meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct \
  --tensor-parallel-size 8 \
  --dtype auto \
  --api-key sk-123456789 \
  --gpu-memory-utilization 0.9 \
  --port 5000
```
Setup the api key:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-123456789
```

```bash
python checking.py --model <model_name> --task <task_type> --operations <operations>
```
