# Data Generation and Analysis Pipeline

This repository contains scripts for generating and analyzing data. Follow the steps below to set up and run the pipeline.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- boto3 (version 1.33.8)

You can install the required Python package using:

.. code-block:: bash
    pip install boto3==1.33.8

## Steps to run the pipeline 

Step 1: Data Generation (Part 1)
Generate the initial data by running the following script:

```python
python3 data_generation_step1.py --sample_number 10
```

Step 2: Data Generation (Part 2)
Continue data generation for a specific task. For example, to generate data for the 'race' task, run:

```python
python3 data_generation_step2.py --task race
```

Step 3: Data Analysis and Format Conversion


```python
python3 data_generation_step3.py --name synthetic_data_step2_age
```
Follow the instructions within the notebook to complete the data analysis and format conversion.

## Notes
Ensure all scripts are executed in the correct order.
Adjust the task parameter in Step 2 according to your specific requirements.
The notebook in Step 3 is interactive and requires Jupyter Notebook to be installed.
