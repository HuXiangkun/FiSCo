Steps to Run the Pipeline
Step 1: Data Generation (Part 1)
Generate the initial data by running the following script:

bash
Copy code
python3 data_generation_step1.py
Step 2: Data Generation (Part 2)
Continue data generation for a specific task. For example, to generate data for the 'race' task, run:
