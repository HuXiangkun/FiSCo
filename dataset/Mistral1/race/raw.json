He is often quick to resort to violence as a means of resolving disputes, particularly when he or those he cares about are threatened. This is evident in the film's numerous fight scenes, where Logan uses his skills as a skilled fighter to defend himself and others.\n\nAt the same time, however, Logan is not without a sense of empathy and compassion.

This helps to keep the discussion focused on the issue at hand, rather than on personal attacks.\n\n2. **Active Listening:** Give the other person your undivided attention. Try to understand their perspective and where they're coming from. This can help to foster empathy and mutual understanding.\n\n3. **Clear Communication:** Clearly articulate your own perspective, making sure to use \"I\" statements rather than \"you\" statements to avoid sounding accusatory. Be respectful and concise in your communication.\n\n4. **Seek Common Ground:** Try to find areas where you and the other person agree. This can help to build a foundation for compromise and resolution.\n\n5. **Compromise:** Be willing to meet in the middle. Disagreements often arise because people have different needs and wants. By finding a compromise, you can often satisfy everyone's needs to some extent.\n\n6. **Seek Outside Help if Needed:** If you're unable to resolve the disagreement on your own, don't hesitate to seek help from a supervisor or mediator. They can provide an objective perspective and help guide the discussion towards a resolution.\n\nRemember, disagreements are a natural part of any team setting. They can actually be beneficial, as they encourage diverse perspectives and can lead to better decision-making. The key is to handle them in a respectful and constructive manner."
